# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

# .github/dependabot.yml
# Basic Dependabot config file for a Jekyll site
# You always need to set this to 2.
version: 2

# This 'updates' block is the main section where you list all the
# different package managers you want Dependabot to check.
updates:

  # This is the first entry in your 'updates' list.
  # Each entry starts with a hyphen (-).
  - 
    # 'package-ecosystem' specifies the package manager.
    # For Jekyll (a Ruby project), the package manager is "bundler"
    # which reads your 'Gemfile' and 'Gemfile.lock'.
    package-ecosystem: "bundler"
    
    # 'directory' tells Dependabot where to find the 'Gemfile'.
    # "/" means the root (main folder) of your repository.
    directory: "/"
    
    # 'schedule' defines how often Dependabot should check for updates.
    schedule:
      # 'interval: "daily"' is the most common setting.
      # Other options are "weekly" or "monthly".
      interval: "daily"
      
    # 'labels' (optional) automatically adds GitHub labels to the
    # pull requests that Dependabot creates. This makes them
    # easy to filter and identify.
    labels:
      - "dependencies"  # A general label for dependency updates
      - "ruby"          # A specific label for Ruby/Bundler updates
